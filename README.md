# Multiplier-Systemverilog-module-with-Formal-Verification-SVA-on-OneSpin

In this project a Multiplier was implemented in SystemVerilog and a SystemVerilogAssertion (sva) file was written o fromally verify the functionalities of the Multiplier. According to the lab task pdf the Multiplier had 2 bugs that needed to be fixed. 
Then we optimized the implementation of the Multiplier to perform the calculation and get the result in no more than 8 clock cycles.
Finally the Multiplier was optimized once more to do its operation in no more than 4 clock cycles.
